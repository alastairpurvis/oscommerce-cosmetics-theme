If you would like to create a 'custom' page of your own on the site, follow these steps:
1) Create a new file in the root directory, title it "YOURPAGENAME.php"
2) Add the following code into the file, changing "MY Page" and "mypage" to whatever you want to call it:
<? $CUSTOMNAME = "My Page";?>		// no tabs or spaces!
<? $CUSTOMFILENAME = "mypage";?>	//must be same as filename
3) Then copy and paste this (don't change it)
<?  require('includes/custompage.php');?>
4) Go to /mypage and it should be a blank page with the header
5) Start adding content!
6) When your done, call the footer
		<?  require('includes/custompagefooter.php');?>
7) That's it!
