  Skin Nutrition is a revolutionary skin care brand leading the way in bio-active skin care, specializing in anti-aging, age reversal, and skin rejuvenation. 
</p>
<p>
<br>
Skin Nutrition is absolutely committed to the development of skin care products that deliver maximum efficacy and results. We are able to achieve this by taking a radically different, bilateral approach by utilizing "leading-edge", technologically advanced ingredients and delivery systems, many of which are proprietary and patented, that penetrate the epidermis to work from the `outside-in'; proprietary nutritional supplements that work from the 'inside-out'; and lastly, we ensure every ingredient we use is compatible with our bodies natural biological processes.  
<br><br>
Sadly, this is not the case with many of the skin care products out there today. Many use 'so-called' actives that are simply not bio-compatible and are unstable in the forms they use, creating no efficacy whatsoever , and many still use mineral oil for their base emulsion, which prevents penetration of any active ingredients and disallows the skin to breath. Why would they do this? For the simple reason that these types of ingredients are far cheaper than the ones that are bio-compatible and have efficacy. 
<br><br>
The Skin Nutrition synergistic strategy reverses cellular inflammation and glycation internally where premature ageing starts, promotes cell and fibroblast reparation and renewal, stimulates skin stem cell proliferation, and repairs and reverses the visible signs of ageing on the surface of the skin.
